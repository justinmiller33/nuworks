The main hypothesis of the laboratory is that we can gain leverage on this physiological problem ? and the related problem of how diseases disrupt brain function ? by studying neural circuits that underlie stimulus-driven innate behaviors. Given that olfaction is the primary sense used by most animals to communicate with their environment, we focus on characterizing those circuits that enable animals to detect and innately respond to scents from food, predators and mates. These circuits are highly constrained by evolution and exhibit stereotyped anatomic and genetic architectures, which significantly facilitates their experimental interrogation. Sensory information propagating through this hardwiring can drive complex behaviors (such as avoidance or sexual displays), alter neuroendocrine states and act as unconditioned stimuli to facilitate learning. We believe that tracing and manipulating the neural wiring that mediate innate behaviors will reveal fundamental and general principles about how information is meaningfully encoded in the brain, how that information is coupled to behavioral centers, and how the circuits which convey that information can dynamically adapt to a changing world. To structurally and functionally dissect olfactory circuits we deploy an interdisciplinary toolkit that includes both well-established techniques ? such as mouse genetics and behavioral analysis ? and emerging approaches ? such as two-photon laser scanning microscopy and optogenetics. We also actively develop new molecular and imaging tools for neural tracing and circuit analysis. These methods allow us to identify specific monomolecular odorants that drive genetically-programmed behaviors, to define peripheral receptors for these odorants, and to characterize the functional architecture of the neural circuits that translate the activation of a specific receptor in the nose into a particular behavioral response. These circuits include well-characterized peripheral components, such as the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb, which trigger activity in parts of the higher mammalian brain whose function is just now beginning to be explored, such as the piriform cortex, the cortical amygdala and olfactory tubercle. In addition to exploring how ethologically-relevant sensory information is encoded in all of these regions, we are actively interested in how this information is sent forward to brain areas such as the ventral striatum and hypothalamus, sites critical to the execution of innate behaviors, to learning and reward, and to the regulation of neuroendocrine status. Importantly, the areas of the cortex implicated in generating innate odor-driven behaviors play potential roles in a number of neural and psychiatric diseases (e.g. panic disorder, addiction). Our characterization of the circuitry that triggers innate odor-driven behaviors may therefore lead to insight into these serious diseases, as well as other disorders related to behavioral valence and motivation.",No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No

DNA damage is ubiquitous and can arise from many sources, including from ultraviolet light and other environmental sources such as pollution and foods. In all organisms there are overlapping pathways to identify and remove DNA damage. However, DNA damage can evade repair pathways and block or stall the process of copying DNA that is required for cell division, which is known as DNA replication. Disrupted DNA replication can lead to mutagenesis and can be lethal to a cell. A specialized family of DNA polymerases with the ability to copy damaged DNA contributes to DNA damage tolerance. Notably, these polymerases do not repair DNA, but rather allow DNA replication to continue in the presence of DNA damage. Individuals with defects in DNA pol eta, which copies DNA containing lesions that result from UV light, are predisposed to skin cancer.The scholar will research the specificity of DNA polymerases for different types of DNA damage, how dynamic interactions between “normal” DNA polymerases, specialized DNA polymerases, and other DNA replication proteins contribute to DNA damage tolerance, and which of the numerous cellular pathways contribute to tolerance to DNA damage. This will be accomplished using biochemical assays, biophysical methods, and molecular biology techniques. The exact project is flexible and will be based on discussion with the applicant. Through this work the Routes scholar will gain an understanding of modern problems and techniques in biochemistry and biotechnology research. The scholar will gain experience in experimental design including the use of appropriate controls. Research experiences include site-directed mutagenesis, molecular cloning, protein purification, biochemical assays, and characterization of cellular responses to DNA damaging agents and mutagens.Scholars are expected to have or be willing to develop excellent laboratory technique. They will be fully active members of the laboratory group, including attending group meetings, discussing research results, and reading and discussing the primary literature. The scholars will be expected to demonstrate creativity and critical thinking in designing experiments and analyzing results.To apply: Please submit a resume and a short cover letter addressing the following questions:1.

Among the chemical classes that are currently causing the most concern among individuals and the public health community are per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS). Current methods for determining an individual's exposure are invasive, expensive, and must be performed by a health care professional. In addition, they only capture a snapshot of blood concentrations that may vary diurnally. A personal passive sampler that could slowly sample PFAS transferred across a person's skin could be used to collect PFAS concentrations more broadly across populations while providing time-averaged data.As a first step in developing trans-dermal personal passive samplers, the Fernandez lab is seeking a ROUTES scholar to research and source existing patches currently used to deliver pharmaceuticals. In addition, the scholar will design and prepare trans dermal patch sampler prototypes from polymer-resin composites in the laboratory. These composites will be tested in time-course experiments for their uptake kinetics and affinity for a set of frequently detected PFAS compounds.

More than two centuries later, that promise sustains our commitment to deliver the most advanced and compassionate care to patients and their families.One of the world's top academic medical centers and home to the largest hospital-based research program in the United States, we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in medicine. As we strive to make a difference today in the health of communities locally and around the world, we also prepare for the future by educating the next generation of healthcare providers and researchers.The Development OfficeThe Development Office is a vibrant and collaborative team focused on advancing the hospital's mission of healthcare excellence. Thanks to our dedicated volunteers and the generosity of our donors and employees, Mass General Hospital consistently raises over $300M annually and its most recent fundraising capital campaign surpassed its $1.5B goal a year ahead of schedule. Beyond these numbers is the major impact in the life of our institution.

The special events team works closely with various other teams and departments both in the Development office and throughout the hospital itself to help foster a strong donor community and show appreciation for the donors, physicians, patients, faculty, and community members that allow MGH to be a leader in national healthcare.My role consisted of a lot of organizational upkeep including managing spreadsheets, maintaining continuity between manual trackers and the automated bookkeeping system (Raiser’s Edge), vendor interaction for specific events, and planning and attending various events to ensure they run smoothly.

HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set) is a performance measurement guide to track important aspects of care provided to customers of health insurance plans. The HEDIS Medical Record Review Team works to assure quality of care for our members at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, collecting data on physician practices and patient outcomes to report to the NCQA healthcare accreditation organization, ultimately helping BCBS maintain its excellent reputation as a premier health insurance company. The candidate will be contacting BCBSMA provider offices to request medical records, reviewing charts to abstract the necessary data, and entering said data into our database application. Students may be reviewing 50-60 charts a day, in both paper and electronic format.There is a possible travel component of this position, as students may be required to go to various healthcare facilities within Massachusetts (ie: UMass, Lahey, Southcoast Hospital) to review records onsite, while maintaining BCBS professionalism. This travel will be concentrated in a 4-6 week period in February and March. Travel expenses will be compensated in addition to the hourly wage offered. BCBS makes a conscious effort to plan this travel strategically based on where each student resides, to avoid unnecessary travel time.Top Criteria/Requirements:1. Computer Skills – Students must be computer savvy: able to navigate different databases, comfortable updating and maintaining Excel spreadsheets, etc.2.

Students should also be open to asking questions; it is better to ask questions than make mistakes that can take time and effort to correct.5. Telephone Skills – Students will be making phone calls to providers’ offices to ask for medical records not received or to request missing clinical information. Professionalism and telephone etiquette are required.Opportunity:This position provides an eye-opening look into the complex and ever-changing industry of health care in the United States. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts is a major healthcare provider, insuring about 2.8 million individuals in MA, as well as across state lines. In a time where health insurance is on the forefront of many political conversations, and on the minds of most Americans, this is a unique opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of the health insurance industry and its efforts to improve care for millions of Americans.1. HEDIS Knowledge – Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the HEDIS review process, a nationally recognized and standardized measurement of quality health care. They will become familiar with the various measurements of care, collected through random sampling of members, both healthy and those with chronic medical conditions.2. Electronic Medical Records – This position will expose students to multiple EMR systems. They will learn to navigate different systems, locate essential clinical information, and work with office staff for assistance if/when difficulties are reached (ie: unable to access certain records or results, computer freezes, etc.) A problem-solving mentality, paired with a sense of flexibility, is essential to working through these systems and their complexities.3.
